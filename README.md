# What You Should See
In the case of calculator above, you should be able to use the calculator to evaluate basic expression. There is no error handling in involved in the solution.

# JavaScript Used

* DOM Manipulation
* Control Structures
* Array.forEach()
* JavaScript CSS Manipulation
* eventListeners
* Immediately Invoked Function Expressions


## Project Description/Summary

This project involves wiring up a simple calculator.

## New Things Learned or Refreshed

I spent most my time starring at the screen.I got my numbers to show up but I couldn't figure out how to do the math and make it show up.I thought the easiest way was to use the eval() function but I read in the MDN documentation to [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval#Do_not_ever_use_eval!](never use eval()). So, I got stuck and lost patience.I ended up watching some solutions from YouTube. **Word of caution**, the solution above works to the extent that the user uses the calculator flawlessly. If not, there are many use cases in which the code won't work and will throw errors. For example, if someone starts with an * operator instead of a number, the eval() function won't work. You'll get an `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token * at HTMLButtonElement.<anonymous>` error.

## Biggest Take Away(s)

I couldn't for the life of me remember how I coded my last calculator project. This goes to show that continuous coding and going back to previous problems is just the name of the game.Â
